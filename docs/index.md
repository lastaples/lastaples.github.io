# Lindsey Staples

I am currently a junior at Rutgers University studying Computer Engineering.  I haven't had too much previous experience in this field unfortunately, but I do have many [personal projects](https://lastaples.github.io/Projects "Projects") that I'm working on to help to further my knowledge in all things programming and engineering.
